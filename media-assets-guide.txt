- Count: Varies by device (40 for mobile, 80 for tablet, 120 for desktop)
- Size: 3-5px
- Movement: Slow drift with gentle sway

## Design Notes

1. Images should be in PNG format with transparency where appropriate (SVG preferred for icons)
2. Avatars and chibis should have a consistent anime-inspired style
3. All audio files should be in MP3 format, optimized for web (128kbps is sufficient)
4. Keep file sizes small for optimal performance (use compression tools)
5. All images should have @2x versions for high-DPI displays (append @2x to filename)
6. Particle effects should be performance-optimized especially for mobile devices
